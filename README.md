# Tubemon
A Pokémon like game in Python.  
A game I added on to after, following a YouTube tutorial by [Chris Cources](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisCourses) called [Pokémon JavaScript Game Tutorial with HTML Canvas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP5DKzriqXA&ab_channel=ChrisCourses).  
I implemented several other features not in the tutorial in Python using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) module such as:
- Title screen
- Pause menu
- Saving and loading games
- LAN Multiplier
- Using Items
- Capturing Wild Tubemon
- Swapping Tubemon in battle
